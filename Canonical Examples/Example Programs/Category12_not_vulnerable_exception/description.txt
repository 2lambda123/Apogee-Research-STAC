Purpose:

	SC Vulnerabilities may go undetected if it is assumed that branching can only be
	achieved with conditionals. This variant of the application replaces the use of
	of conditionals with exception handling but balances the different branches to 
	prevent an SC vulnerability. 

Usage details:

	Start the challenge application and submit a password guess to the server.
