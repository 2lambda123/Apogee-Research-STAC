Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which a
	third party can determine a user's secret value stored by the server?

Available Operations:
	
	Passive Operations:  observe a single request packet, corresponding 
                             response packets and timings thereof
                             (cost: 1 per observed request packet and 
                             corresponding response)

	Active Operations:  issue a single request packet and monitor the 
                            induced response traffic for this single 
                            request packet
                            (cost: 1 per request packet)

	Oracle Query:	    query the oracle with a guess and receive a binary
                            response (yes if entirely correct, no otherwise)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 100
	Probability of success   : 90%
