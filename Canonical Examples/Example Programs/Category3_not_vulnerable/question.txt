	Category3.jar

Challenge Question:

	Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program that would allow a
	third party to determine the secret value?

Available Operations:
	
	Passive Operations: none
	Active Operations : run the challenge problem with any input
                            (cost 1 per operation)
	Oracle Query:       query the oracle with a guess and receive a binary
                      	    response (yes if entirely correct, no otherwise)
                            (cost 1 per operation)

Operational Budget:

	Max number of operations : 100
  	Probability of success   : 90%
