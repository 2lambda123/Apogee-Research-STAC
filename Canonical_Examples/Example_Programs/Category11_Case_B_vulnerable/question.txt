Challenge Program:

        Category11_Case_B.jar

Challenge Question:

        Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program that would allow a
        third party to determine the secret?

Available Operations:

        Passive Operations: none
        Active Operations:  send a single tcp request to the running challenge application
			    and receive a response.
                      	    (cost 1 per operation)
	Oracle Query:       query the oracle with a guess and receive a binary
                            response (yes if entirely correct, no otherwise)

Operational Budget:

        Max number of operations : 100
        Probability of success   : 90%
