Purpose:

	Vulnerabilities may go undetected if the effect of multiple dimensions of
	user input is disregarded. Given input restriction of 8 bytes, and input
        dimensions of a,b,c, resource usage maximized with a = b = c = 99 rather
        than other variants maximizing a, b, or c individually (e.g. a=b=99 and
        c = 9999)
  

Usage details:

  	User provides three integer string inputs separated by " ". The challenge 
	program server responds with "Process Complete", "Unable to Process Input"
        or "Queue Full".
