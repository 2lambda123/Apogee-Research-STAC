Overview
========
These applications are simple examples to help researchers recognize and address
different types of vulnerabilities that their tools may miss. The 
vulnerabilities in these applications were developed and tested for the common
reference environment detailed in the STAC Reference Platform Document (V1).

The Example Programs directory contains questions and compiled jar for each 
example. The questions reference the SC definition and AC definition V0 and
extension V1 repository README. The Source directory contains the source code
for all examples. The Canonical Examples PDF document contains details on the
vulnerability in each example program.
