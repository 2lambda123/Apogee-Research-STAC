Overview
========
These applications are complex applications to test the ability of research tools to identify STAC
vulnerabilities. This set of challenges are from STAC Engagement 1 and 2. The vulnerabilities in
these applications were developed and tested for the common reference environment detailed in the
STAC Reference Platform Document (V0). All remote application interactions occur over localhost on 
a single reference device. These challenges are packaged to run in docker containers as each 
application may required different dependencies.

Folder Structure
================
Each challenge application is contained within a separate folder.
