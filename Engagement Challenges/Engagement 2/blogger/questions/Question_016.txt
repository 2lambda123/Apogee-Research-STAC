Challenge Program:

    nanohttpd-javawebserver-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge program's 
    memory usage to exceed the resource usage limit given the budget?

Additional background for question:

    The server can support mutliple users but for this question assumes there is only one
    user interacting with the system in any vulnerability demonstration.

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the TCP requests sent from the user to the server: 5000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Memory: 512 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
