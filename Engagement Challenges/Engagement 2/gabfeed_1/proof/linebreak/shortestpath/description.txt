LineBreak_1: Shortest Path Line Breaking
----------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time

The shortest path line breaking algorithm has O(n * width) behavior, where n is the number of words.
The algorithm has O(n^2) behavior when the width is at least as long as the number of words.
Normally, there is a JavaScript function that finds the width in pixels of the column
where the text will be, and it determines the text width based on that number of pixels. The function then
issues a PUT to https://localhost:8080/width/<found width>, which sets the width. The width set this way should
never be large enough to show bad behavior because it is based on how large the screen and browser are, and
these values should always be relatively small. However, it is possible to set the width manually by issuing a
PUT to that URL with any desired width. The attacker can set an exceptionally long width then post a long message.
