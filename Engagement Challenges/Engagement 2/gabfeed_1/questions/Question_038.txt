Challenge Program:

    gabfeed_1.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge 
    program's memory usage to exceed the resource usage limit in one user session
    given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    GabFeed is a web based application that supports multiple users, however, this question 
    assumes there is only one user interacting with the system in any vulnerability demonstration.

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the HTTP requests sent from the user to the server: 400000 bytes

Resource Usage Limit:
    
    Available Memory: 512 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
