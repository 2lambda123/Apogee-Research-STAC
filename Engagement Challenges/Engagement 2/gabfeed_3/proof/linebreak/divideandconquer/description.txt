LineBreak_2: Divide and Conquer Line Breaking
---------------------------------------------
Benign

The divide and conquer line breaking algorithm has O(n log n) behavior, where n is the number of words.

Normally, there is a JavaScript function that finds the width in pixels of the column
where the text will be, and it determines the text width based on that number of pixels. The function then
issues a PUT to https://localhost:8080/width/<found width>, which sets the width. The width set this way should
never be large enough to show bad behavior because it is based on how large the screen and browser are, and
these values should always be relatively small. However, it is possible to set the width manually by issuing a
PUT to that URL with any desired width. The attacker can set an exceptionally long width then post a long message.

Unlike the shortest path line breaking kernel, this attack does not effect the divide and conquer line breaking kernel
which has O(n log n) behavior either way and is thus not vulnerable to the attack.
