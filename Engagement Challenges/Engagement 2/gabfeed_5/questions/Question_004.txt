Challenge Program:

    gabfeed_5.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which a third
    party can discover the server's private key used in the server's authentication?
    Note: This is referring to the private key for authentication at
    https://localhost:8080 not the private key for establishing an SSL connection.

Additional background for question:

    For the sake of this problem, a user session is defined as the user
    interactions between (and including) the establishment of a session key to
    the renegotiation of the next session key. The session key is related to an 
    SSL session and not related to the server's private key.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: observe the encrypted packets within a single user session 
                        or authentication of the server (cost 1 per session)
    Active Operations:  Issue an HTTP request and receive a response. (cost 1 per operation)
    Oracle Query:       query the oracle with a candidate private key to get a binary
                        response (yes/no) as to whether the candidate key is the server's
                        private key (cost 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 60000
    Probability of success   : 95%
