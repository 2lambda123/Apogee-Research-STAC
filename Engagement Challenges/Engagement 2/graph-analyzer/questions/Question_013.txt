Challenge Program:

    GraphDisplay.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge 
    program's memory usage to exceed the resource usage limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input file: 5000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Memory: 512 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
