Overview
========
The Law Enforcement Employment Database Server is a network service application that provides access to 
records about law enforcement personnel. Employee information is referenced with a unique employee ID number.
The database contains restricted and unrestricted employee information. The ID numbers of law enforcement 
personnel working on clandestine activities is restricted information.  

Interactions
===========
The database supports the following functionality: 
SEARCH    - search law enforcement personnel by a range of employee ID numbers 
INSERT    - create a new employee ID number
 
Standard users can search, view, add unrestricted employee IDs and associated information. If a standard 
user makes a query for a range of IDs that contains one or more restricted IDs, the restricted IDs will not 
be included in the returned data.

The runClient.sh script provided in the examples directory will allow you to interact with the database as a
standard user.

Engagement Tools
================
The start script (runServer.sh) for the database server is located in the challenge_program directory. Once
the server is started, the script will output "UDP Server Up and Running".

Notes
=====
The runServer.sh script and the files contained in the server directory are provided to start the database
server and seed it to a realistic state. These files would not be available to standard users.

The supplied database contains no record files.
