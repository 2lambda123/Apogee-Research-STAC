Challenge Program:

    DistributedStore.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time that would cause the challenge
    program's real runtime (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage limit
    given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the UDP requests sent from the user to the server: 
    1000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Runtime: 30 seconds measured as the time interval between sending the last byte of the 
    attack and the server sending the last byte of the response.
