FilterHandler_2: Filter Image with Incorrect Repeat Prevention
--------------------------------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Space (Memory)
This handler limits the total number of filters that can be applied and also attempts to
 prevent the user from using the same filter on more than one image.

However, the user is able to apply the ScaleUp filter more than once by observing that the
check to see if the filter is already applied is case-sensitive, but the code that gets
the filter to apply is case-insensitive.  Thus the attacker can specify the the same
filter multiple times by using different case for each application of the filter. (e.g.
F00E, F00e, f00E, f00e)
