friends_1: Friends Side Channel
-------------------------------
Side Channel Vulnerability,
Type: Size

In SnapBuddy, the profile for every person is public.  A SnapBuddy
user is permitted to see the public profile of every other user either
by displaying their friends or the users that can be invited to be
friends.  As a result, the size of each profile photo image can be
mapped directly to a user.  If there are collisions, the identity
cannot be resolved from the profile photo image information alone.

In the case of a collision we assume the attacker can make an oracle
query to find the correct user.  In this data set, the maximum overlap is
2 users.  As a result the attack can be successful in at most 2 observations.

We assume the profile photo image to size mapping is fairly static and that
an attacker has already queried the system to characterize generic responses.

In our proof, the user is simulated with the interact.py script
(located under snapbuddy_<num>/benign).

In our attack proof, we have pre-computed the profile photo image->size
database.  This speeds up testing a great deal.  However, if desired,
the database can be rebuilt when performing the attack by executing
'./malicious.sh rebuild'.
