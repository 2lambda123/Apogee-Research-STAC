Challenge Question

    Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which a third 
    party can learn information that allows them to impersonate any given user?

Additional background for question:

    For the sake of this problem, a user session is defined as the user 
    interactions between (and including) the establishment of a session key to 
    the regnegotiation of the next session key. The session key is related to an
    SSL session and is not related to the server's private key.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: observe the encrypted packets and timings thereof within a single user 
                        session (cost: 1 per session)
    Active Operations:  issue an HTTP request and receive a response (no cost per query)
    Oracle queries:     query the oracle to get a binary response (yes/no) as to whether
                        or not you have collected a valid secret from any given user such 
                        that you can impersonate that user
                        (cost 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 10000
    Probability of success   : 95%
