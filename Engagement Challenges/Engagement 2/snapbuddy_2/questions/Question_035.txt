Challenge Program:

    snapbuddy_2.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge 
    program's memory usage to exceed the resource usage limit in one user session
    given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    SnapBuddy is a web based application that supports multiple users, however, this
    question assumes there is only one user interacting with the system in any
    vulnerability demonstration.

    For the sake of this problem, a user session is defined as the user
    interactions between (and including) the establishment of a session key to
    the renegotiation of the next session key. The session key is related to an
    SSL session and is not related to the server's private key.

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the HTTP requests sent from the user to the server: 10000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Memory: 512 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
