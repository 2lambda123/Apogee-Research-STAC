Overview
========
Are you the captain of a starship? Do you wish you could send anonymous hails to nearby starships? 
Maybe you're a Federation vessel with damaged warp nacelles and you want to suss out whether a 
nearby vessel is trustworthy before you ask for assistance? Or maybe you're a Ferengi trading ship 
and want to advertise your wares before people see your ears and jump to conclusions? Either way, 
Subspace has you covered.

Subspace is an anonymous, local messaging server. Registered users provide their locations to the server. 
When a user wants to send a message, the message is anonymously delivered to the nearest other user. At 
this point, the two users can continue to communicate anonymously for as long as they wish, even if they 
are no longer nearby.

Interactions
============
Users can register by creating a username and password and providing an email address. After registration,
users receive a confirmation email with instructions on confirming the registration. After confirmation, 
users can set their locations and hail (send a message to) the nearest starship (application user).

All valid user clients connect on port 8443

Examples of user interactions are provided in the examples directory

Engagement Tools
================
A full deployment involves setting up a fair bit of infrastructure, but the Docker image contains everything 
you need. Instructions for use are provided when you start the container. 

The Docker image sets up a mail server and client to be used for the application.

Notes
=====
When the Docker container is started the application will be started and users will be added to seed the 
application to a realistic state. It is recommended that you use the scripts in the examples directory for
the user interactions (registration, confirmation, setting/updating a user's location).

The Docker image uses ports 8080, 8443 and 2525. Ensure those ports are not in use prior to starting the container.

The files located in the /home/subspace within the Docker container and the challenge_program directory
are used to seed the application to a realistic state. The contents of these files are out of scope for the
challenge program.
