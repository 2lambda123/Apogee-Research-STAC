Challenge Question:

    Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program from which a third party can 
    learn information that allows them to impersonate any given user?    

Additional background for question:

    For the sake of this problem, a user session is defined as the user
    interactions between (and including) the establishment of a session key to
    the renegotiation of the next session key. The session key is related to an
    SSL session.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: observe the encrypted packets within a single user session
                        (cost 1 per session)
    Active Operations:  Issue an HTTP request to the server and receive a response. 
                        (cost 1 per operation)
    Oracle Query:       query the oracle to get a binary response (yes/no) as to whether
                        or not you have collected a valid secret from any given user such
                        that you can impersonate that user
                        (cost 1 per query)
    
Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 100,000
    Probability of success   : 95%
