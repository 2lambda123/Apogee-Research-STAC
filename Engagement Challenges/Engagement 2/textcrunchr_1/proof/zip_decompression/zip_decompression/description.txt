zip_1: Zip Bomb
---------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time
Our zip file decompression will recurse on any zip file it encounters that contains embedded zip files.
This means that a zip file that decompresses to itself, for instance, could cause the decompressor to run forever.

This version of the kernel has a check in an attempt to limit the total number of files decompressed, but that check is
flawed and a well crafted zip file can exploit this vulnerability.
