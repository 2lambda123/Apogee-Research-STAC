sort_1: Polymorphic sort with bad quicksort
-------------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time

The sorting algorithm typically has O(nlogn) behavior but can have O(n^2) behavior given certain
inputs. This vulnerability is triggered via quicksort, but due to permutation
of the list done prior to quicksort it is insufficient to simply pass a sorted input to
the program. The vulnerability is triggered when you pass the algorithm a list shuffled in such a way that
the list is permuted to a sorted list prior to quicksort.
