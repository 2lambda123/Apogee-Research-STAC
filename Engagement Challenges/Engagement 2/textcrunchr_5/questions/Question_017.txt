Challenge Program:

    textcrunchr_5.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge program's memory 
    usage to exceed the resource usage limit given the input budget?


Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input file (or files): 400000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Memory: 512 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
