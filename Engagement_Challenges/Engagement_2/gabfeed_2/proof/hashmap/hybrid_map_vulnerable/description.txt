HashMap_2: Tree based vulnerable hash table
-------------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time

This article uses a tree based hash table vulnerable to denial of service. While it uses a tree, that tree is not
balanced and as a result collisions can still result in bad performance (e.g. if the items are added in sorted order).

An attacker need simply post one large message with words that have hash collisions and performance will become O(n^2)
and the time limit will be exceeded.
