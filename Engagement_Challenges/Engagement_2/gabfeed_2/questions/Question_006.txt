Challenge Program:

    gabfeed_2.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time that would cause the challenge
    program's real runtime (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage limit
    given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    GabFeed is a web based application that supports multiple users, however, this question assumes 
    there is only one user interacting with the system in any vulnerability demonstration. 

Input Budget:

    Maximum sum of the PDU sizes of the HTTP requests sent from the user to the server: 400000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:
    
    Runtime: 150 seconds measured as the time interval between sending the last byte of the attack and 
    the server sending the last byte of the response.
