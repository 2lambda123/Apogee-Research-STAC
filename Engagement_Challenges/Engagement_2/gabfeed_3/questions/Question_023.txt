    gabfeed_3.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there a side channel in time in the challenge program with which a third party 
    can identify how many 'special' search terms a user has searched for within the
    operational budget?

Additional background for question:

    For the purpose of the question, assume that a user session will include at most 30 
    HTTP request/recieve response pairs.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: observe the encrypted request and corresponding response packets
                        and timings thereof for a single user session
                        (cost: 1 per observed user session)
    Active Operations:  issue an HTTP request and receive a response (no cost per request)
    Oracle queries:     query the oracle with the candidate number of 'special' searches and
                        receive a binary response (yes/no) as to whether the candidate number
                        of 'special' search terms is correct. (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 2 operations
    Probability of success  :  90%
