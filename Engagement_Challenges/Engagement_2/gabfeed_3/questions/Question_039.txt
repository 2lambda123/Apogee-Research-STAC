Challenge Question:

    Is there a side channel in time and space in the challenge program with which a
    third party can identify if a user has searched for a single 'special' search term and
    which specific 'special' term was searched for first within the operational budget?

Additional background for question:

    For the purpose of the engagement assume that if a user will execute a special search
    it will be one of their first three actions after logging in. Each search of a special term
    is independent of all prior searches.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: observe the encrypted request and corresponding response packets
                        and timings thereof for a single user http action
                        (cost: 1 per observed action)
    Active Operations:  issue an HTTP request and receive a response (no cost per request)
    Oracle queries:     query the oracle with a candidate search term to get a binary response
                        (yes/no) as to whether the candidate search term is the user's 'special'
                        search term. (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 5 operations
    Probability of success  :  90%
