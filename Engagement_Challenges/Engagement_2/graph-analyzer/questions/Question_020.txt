Challenge Program:

    GraphDisplay.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in time that would cause the challenge
    program's real runtime (on the reference platform) to exceed the resource usage limit
    given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input file (or files): 5000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Runtime: 1 hour measured from the submission of the last byte of input to the completion
             of the command execution.
