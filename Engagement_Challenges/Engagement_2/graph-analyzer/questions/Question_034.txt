Challenge Program:

    GraphDisplay.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity in space that would cause the challenge 
    program to output a file with a logical size that exceeds the resource usage
    limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input file: 5000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Logical Size: 400 MB (virtual size of outputfile measured with 'stat')
