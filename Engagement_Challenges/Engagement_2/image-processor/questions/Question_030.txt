Challenge Program:

    ipchallenge-0.1.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there an algorithmic complexity vulnerability in space that would cause the memory usage 
    of the challenge program to exceed the resource usage limit given the input budget?

Additional background for question:

    None

Input Budget:

    Total size of input commands to the challenge program including the classification image files submitted: 70000 bytes
    
Resource Usage Limit:

    Available Memory: 2048 MB (total memory usage of the JVM shown under the RSS column in pmap -x <PID>)
