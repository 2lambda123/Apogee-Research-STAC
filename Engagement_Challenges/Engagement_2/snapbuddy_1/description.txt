Overview
========
SnapBuddy is a web application for image sharing. Users can login to SnapBuddy to upload photos to share 
with their friends. Photos can be marked public in which case any user of the system can view them (all 
profile photos are public). Photos that aren't marked public should only be viewable by the owner and
their friends. In addition to uploading photos, users can apply filters to their photos to change how they
look. Finally, users are able to have the server tell them their current location (similar to how observed 
WiFi access points can be used to determine a user's location). Once their location is set, they can see the
people around them in that location (location changes can only occur a certain number of times per day), and
their neighbors can see them.

Interactions
============
Users can sign in to the login page: https://localhost:8080/login and log in with valid credentials. Once a 
user is signed in the user will set their location and confirm their location. The will then be directed to 
their home page from where they can then proceed to view their friends, send and receive friend invitations, 
upload filter and share photos, and find other SnapBuddy users nearby.

Optionally users can authenticate the SnapBuddy server by browsing to https://localhost:8080.

Examples of user interactions are provided using curl in the examples directory.

Engagement Tools
================
The start script (start.sh) for the SnapBuddy server is located in the challenge_program directory. Once the
server is started the script will output "Server started on port 8080".

An example user is provided: Username: devenmartinez@hotmail.com; Password: PS1Ljv4NPs.

The interact.py script provided in the examples directory will allow you to simulate user interactions.

The start_exchange_verifier.sh script provided in the examples directory will generate a public key to be used
for the user authentication challenge to the SnapBuddy server. The script will also provide the expected server
response to the user's authetication challenge.

Notes
=====
The start.sh script, the ServerPasswordKey.txt, the ServerPrivateKey.txt, and the files in the 
challenge_program/bin directory are provided to start the SnapBuddy server. These files would not be available 
to SnapBuddy users.

There are files in the resources directory (snapbuddy.jks, accesspoints.csv, and several initial*.csv) that are 
not in scope. They are used to seed the application to a realistic state. These files and how they are parsed 
are not intended to be analyzed nor should malicious data be inserted into these files.
