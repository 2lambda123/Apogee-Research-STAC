FilterHandler_3: Filter Image with Correct Repeat Prevention
--------------------------------------------------------------
Benign
This handler limits the total number of filters that can be applied and also attempts to
 prevent the user from using the same filter on more than one image.

In this version of the kernel the filter handler properly checks the specified kernel in a case-
insensitive manner and as a result it is not vulnerable to repeated use of the same filter.
