Challenge Program:

    Subspace.jar

Challenge Question:

    Is there a side channel in space in the challenge program from which a third party can discover 
    the location of any user using the Subspace application?

Additional background for question:

    Assume that users will not change their location during the attack.

Available Operations:

    Passive Operations: None
    Active Operations:  issue an HTTP request and receive a response (1 cost per query)
    Oracle queries:     query the oracle with a candidate location to get a binary
                        response (yes/no) as to whether there is a user at that location.
                        (cost: 1 per query)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 2500 Operations     
    Probability of success   : 90% (where success is defined as correctly identifying a user's location to 
                               1e-4 degrees latitude and 1e-4 degrees longitude)
