HashMap_1: Standard vulnerable hash table
-----------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time

This article uses a hash table vulnerable to denial of service. While a plain text file with collisions isn't large
enough to trigger the vulnerability (due to our input size budget), a compressed file (which TextCrunchr supports)
enables an attacker to send enough data to cause the program to exceed the allowed amount of time.
