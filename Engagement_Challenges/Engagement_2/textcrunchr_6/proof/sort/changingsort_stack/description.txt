sort_2: Polymorphic sort with bad partitioning
----------------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time

The sorting algorithm typically has O(nlogn) behavior but can have O(n^2) or worse
behavior depending on what recurrence relation this instance of the sort was given.
This vulnerability is triggered by incorrect division of the sorting problem, which occurs
for inputs of a certain length. This vulnerability does not depend on the contents of the collection
being sorted, only on the size of the collection.
