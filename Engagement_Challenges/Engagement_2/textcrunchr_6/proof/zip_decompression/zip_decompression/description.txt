zip_2: Safe Zip Decompression
-----------------------------
Benign
Our zip file decompression will recurse on any zip file it encounters that contains embedded zip files.
This means that a zip file that decompresses to itself, for instance, could cause the decompressor to run forever.

This version of the kernel is safe as it properly checks to make sure it hasn't recursed too far.
