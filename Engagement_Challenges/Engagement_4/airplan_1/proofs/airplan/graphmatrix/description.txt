graph_size_benign_nopad: Safe Graph Matrix Handler with no content padding
-----------------------------------------------
Type: Benign

This article displays the graph submitted by a user in a "standard" form, which does not reveal the size of the graph.  The graph is
displayed in table form, with the number of edges between each pair of nodes. Entries in this table are not padded,
so that variations in username lengths, vertex name lengths, and the number of edges between nodes mask the number of nodes in the size of the overall content.
