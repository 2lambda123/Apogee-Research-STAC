graph_connectivity_rp: Vulnerable Graph Properties Handler
-----------------------------------------------
Benign

This article displays graph properties in such a way that the size of the packet does NOT reveal whether or not the graph is connected.

In this version, all property values are padded randomly.  However, the parameter that causes the random padding is well-hidden.  It is
controlled by the parameter "should_adjust" in the ParameterHandler held by the MapPropertiesHandler. It appears that this value
is set to false in the MapProperties constructor.  However, it is misspelled there, with the number 1 in place of the letter l in "should".
Therefore, it is determined by the default value returned for unknown parameters, which is true in this version.
