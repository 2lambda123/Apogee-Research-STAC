ShortestPath_2: Dijkstra's Algorithm
------------------------------------
Benign
Dijkstra's algorithm has a complexity of O(ElogV), where E is the number of edges and V
is the number of vertices, but it does not work in the presence of negative edge weights.

This variation, does not follow negative edge weight cycles and rejects running on
any graph that has them. As a result it is not vulnerable.
