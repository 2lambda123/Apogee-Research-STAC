graph_size_benign_random: Safe Graph Matrix Handler with random content padding
-----------------------------------------------
Type: Benign

This article displays the graph submitted by a user in a "standard" form, which does not reveal the size of the graph.  The graph is
displayed in table form, with the number of edges between each pair of nodes. Entries in this table are padded with random whitespace,
so that the number of nodes does not uniquely determine the size of the overall content.
