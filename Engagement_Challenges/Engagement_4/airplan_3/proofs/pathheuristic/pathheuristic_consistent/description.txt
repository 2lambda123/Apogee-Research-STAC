AStar_1: A* with consistent heuristic
-------------------------------------
Benign

The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic used to consider routes.
The optimal, consistent heuristic results in a linear complexity, while an
inconsistent heuristic results in exponential time.

This kernel uses a consistent heuristic and is thus not vulnerable to an attack.
