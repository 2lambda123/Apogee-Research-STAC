graph_size_sc: Vulnerable Graph Matrix Handler
-----------------------------------------------
Side Channel Vulnerability
Type: Space

This article displays the graph submitted by a user in a "standard" form, which reveals the size of the graph.  The graph is
displayed in table form, with a row and column for each node, with the capacity between each pair of nodes. Both vertex names
and capacities are padded so that the number of nodes uniquely determines the size of the overall content -- the size of this
table is on the order of n^2, where n is the number of nodes. An observer can therefore
determine the size of the graph uploaded by the size of the server's response packet.

When a user uploads a route map, Airplan requires them to view a sequence of pages, in order, (wizard-style) before they are able to
access the majority of Airplan's features.  So, there is a sequence of packets that an attacker can identify. First, after uploading a graph,
the user has to select which of the edge weights to use for the properties page.  This weight selector page has an identifiable size range.
This is followed by the graph properties page, which also has an identifiable size range.  Finally, the page after that is the graph matrix.

The vulnerable code lies in FlightMatrixHandler.handleGet(), which is called upon a user uploading a route map and clicking through the
weight selector page.
