ShortestPath_1: Bad Dijkstra's Algorithm
----------------------------------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Time
Dijkstra's algorithm has a complexity of O(ElogV), where E is the number of edges and V
is the number of vertices, but it does not work in the presence of negative edge weights.

This variation of Dijkstra's algorithm, when subjected to negative edge-weight cycles,
continues to follow the cycle, greedily decreasing the total cost, and never terminating.

The vulnerable code can be reached via the following sequence of method calls:
ShortestPathHandler.getContents()->GraphProxy.getShortestPath->ShortestPath.shortestPath().
This would occur when a user elects to perform a shortest path computation.
