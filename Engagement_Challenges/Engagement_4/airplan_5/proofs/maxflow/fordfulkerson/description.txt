MaxFlow_3: Benign Ford Fulkerson
-------------------------
Benign

The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum flow has worst-case algorithmic
complexity O(E*f), where is E is the number of edges and f is the maximum flow. Generally,
Ford-Fulkerson runs much faster: as the capacity of the augmenting path gets close to the maximum
flow, the runtime approaches O(E). The worst-case algorithmic complexity arises when
the capacity of the augmenting path is very small, but the maximum flow is extremely
large. However, in this implementation, the order in which paths are explored is fixed, so
this worst-case cannot be achieved.
