xml_1: XML Bomb
---------------
Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability,
Type: Space (memory) 

The XML parser is vulnerable to the "Billion LOLs" attack wherein
XML entity references are expanded without bound, allowing the
 attacker to force exponential behavior.

The same (or slighly modified vulnerability) allows for recursive
XML entity declarations. An example file exhibiting this behavior is available in
'lol.xml'.

When an XML file is loaded, the following methods are called:
stac.airplan.handler.AddRouteMapHandler.handlePost()
stac.common.graph.XmlFileLoader.loadGraph()

The following methods get called repeatedly...
org.kxml2.io.KXmlParser.next()
org.kxml2.io.KXmlParser.readValue()
org.kxml2.io.KXmlParser.readEntity()
java.lang.StringBuilder.append()
java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.append()
... until heap space is exhausted

Note: These method calls are subject to our renaming transform.
