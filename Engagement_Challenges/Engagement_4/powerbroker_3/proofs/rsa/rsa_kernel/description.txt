rsa_unreachable: RSA Decryption
---------------------
Benign??

This RSA is potentially vulnerable, but the vulnerability requires extra operations
to exploit because the connection handshake does not allow the attacker to
ask the victim to decrypt multiple challenge messages in a single handshake.

Specifically, in the comms framework, during the connection setup, there is a step
where the two peers (call them "Alice" and "Bob") exchange RSA public
keys. Alice will challenge Bob to make sure that he is really in
possession of the secret key associated to the transmitted public key.
To do this, she sends him a random value, encrypted with his public
key, and asks that he decrypt it and send her back the value as
proof. In this version, if he answers incorrectly, instead of sending him another challenge,
she tells him that he has failed, and the connection is terminated. If Alice
were to send him another challenge, he would not respond to her.

The connection setup takes place in comms.internal.CryptoState.

In the literature, attacks on RSA implemented this way require very few timings -- 300 for a 1024-bit key when timing operations on a smart card.
The STAC environment is noisier, and this version requires a separate handshake for each challenge, quadrupling the operations needed.  It is
unclear whether an attack exists that can exploit this version in the provided operational budget.
