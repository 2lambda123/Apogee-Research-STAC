DESCRIPTION
-----------

This challenge consists of an HTTP service that calculates Traveling
Salesman-style tours between sets of places specified by a user. The
places must be chosen from among a fixed set of places with which the
server is configured at startup. As delivered, the server is
configured with the 25 largest cities in Massachusetts.

A user submits an HTTP request specifying a list of places they want
to visit. The service responds with a reordered list giving an
approximately optimal order in which to visit them.


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------

Users might wish to keep private the set of places for which they
submit a query. They might use the service to plan optimal orders for
errands, meetings, and other movements of varying sensitivity. While
the example configuration uses cities (in keeping with the classic
formulation of the traveling saleman problem), the same service could
be used to calculate tours between any set of geographical points with
which it is configured.

As delivered, the server is configured to use HTTPS.


USAGE
-----

To start the server:

    $ ./scripts/serve.sh

To query the server, curl scripts are provided. To get the list of
available cities:

    $ ./scripts/query.sh places

To calculate a tour:

    $ ./scripts/query.sh tour place1 place2 ...
