transfer_1 File Transfer Side Channel
------------------------------------
Side Channel Vulnerability
Type: Space

This version of file transfer splits a file into fixed sized chunks and then compresses them, yielding a unique size fingerprint for 
each of the included files (in spite of their all having the same original size.)  Thus, an attacker observing network packet sizes
can determine which file has been sent.  (Note: random padding is added to mask the size of the sent chunks but only after the end of 
the actual compressed file bytes, leaving the size signature intact in the first chunks sent.)

This can be exploited when a user issues the command to send a file (\sendfile i). This leads to the following chain of method calls:
(Note that package, class, and method names may be modified by transformers.)

console.Console.executeCommand()
withmi.SendFileCommand.execute()
withmi.filetransfer.FileTransfer.send()
