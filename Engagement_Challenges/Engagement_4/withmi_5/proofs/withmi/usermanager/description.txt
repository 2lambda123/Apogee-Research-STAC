PreviousConnections_2: Previous Connections Side Channel
--------------------------------------------------------
Benign

WithMi's communications framework is set up such that a user provides her identity, a string, with her
RSA public key to the user with whom she is connecting. Users store the information of everyone they have connected to
in a file called previous_users.txt. If userA has never connected to userB before, userA stores userB's identity and
her public key in that file when they first connect. If userA has connected to userB before, userA does not need to
store userB's information.
In the vulnerable version, userA sends a message to userB once he has finished handling userB's information.
In this benign version, userA sends the message before userA has determined whether or not he needs to store
userB's information. UserA always sends this message independent of whether they have connected to userB before,
and an attacker is not able to determine if userA and userB have previously connected.

In the UserManager class (or a class created by our transformers from the UserManager class), in method addUserToUserHistory(), we have:
    // this message is what the attacker would see
    withMi.sendReceipt(true, 0, user);

    // this is the code that takes a significant amount of time
    // since this happens after withMi.sendReceipt(), an attacker is not able to see
    // how long this takes
    if (!previouslyConnected) {
        storeUser(user);
    }

This portion of code is reached after a user issues a command to connect to this user, leading to the following chain of methods on the victim's side:

withmi.WithMiDispatcher.handleNewConnection()
java.util.ExecutorService.submit()
withmi.WithMiDispatcher.NewConnectionHandler.run()  (called by java.util.ExecutorService)
withmi.WithMi.handleConnection()
withmi.UserManager.addUserToUserHistory()

(The same method is also reached for the user issuing a connect command, but no other user can time how long it takes in that case, since
they don't know when the command was issued.)

Note that package, class, and method names may be modified by transformers.
